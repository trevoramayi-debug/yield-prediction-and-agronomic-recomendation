# Prediction & recommendation API — reference

**Kenya maize district yield model and agronomic recommendation layer, served
over HTTP.**

The service wraps the district-level model described in
[kenya_maize_district_model_deployment.md](kenya_maize_district_model_deployment.md).
That document is the authority on what the model can and cannot do, and
[kenya_maize_recommendation_layer.md](kenya_maize_recommendation_layer.md) is
the authority on how the advice is estimated; this one covers the HTTP
contract.

## 1 · Running it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/build_api_defaults.py        # once, and after any feature rebuild
python scripts/build_lever_curves.py        # once, and after any feature rebuild
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Interactive docs at `/docs`, the OpenAPI schema at `/openapi.json`.

### The model artefact

`pipeline.joblib` is 57–125 MB and **is not in git** — it exceeds GitHub's file
limit, so `.gitignore` excludes it. The service boots without it: `/health`,
`/api/v1/model/summary` and the reference endpoints keep working while the
prediction endpoints return `503` with an actionable message. Supply it one of
three ways:

| How | Set |
|---|---|
| Artefact already on disk | `MODEL_DIR=/path/to/district_v2` |
| Download on first use | `MODEL_URL=https://…/district_v2.zip` (also accepts `.tar.gz` or a bare `pipeline.joblib`) |
| Build it | `python scripts/train_district_model.py --train 2016-2020 --val 2019,2020 --test none --out data/models/district_v2` |

Add `--no-nn` when training to drop the neural member: no torch dependency,
roughly half the artefact size, and about 0.02 R² on the 2020 season.

### Environment

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port to bind. |
| `MODEL_DIR` | `data/models/district_v2` | Artefact directory. |
| `MODEL_URL` | — | Archive to download when `MODEL_DIR` is empty. |
| `MODEL_VERSION` | the directory name | Reported in every response. |
| `MODEL_EAGER_LOAD` | `false` | Load the weights during startup rather than on the first request. |
| `FEATURE_DEFAULTS_PATH` | `data/api/feature_defaults.json` | Fill values. |
| `MAX_PLOTS_PER_REQUEST` | `500` | Request size cap. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Comma-separated allowed origins. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Python log level. |

**Pin `pandas<3`.** The pipeline resolves its categorical columns with
`dtype == object` (`scripts/district_model.py`, `load_schema`). On pandas 3 text
columns arrive as `str`, that test matches nothing, and target encoding silently
degrades. `requirements.txt` pins it.

---

## 2 · `POST /api/v1/predict`

Scores plots and the district means they roll up into.

### Request

Only `district` is required. Every other field is optional, and anything omitted
is filled from that district's own history rather than rejected — so a sparse
request still scores. `GET /api/v1/reference/input-schema` returns every field
with its allowed values and observed range.

```json
{
  "plots": [
    {
      "plot_id": "farm-104",
      "district": "bungoma",
      "year": 2020,
      "plot_acres": 1.5,
      "seed_category": "hybrid_branded",
      "dap_kg_ph": 60,
      "can_kg_ph": 50,
      "plant_date": "2020-03-15",
      "cows": 2,
      "owns_electricity": true
    }
  ],
  "include_plot_predictions": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `district` | string, **required** | Case-insensitive. Unknown districts are scored and flagged, not rejected. |
| `year` | integer | Defaults to the latest training season. |
| `plot_acres` | number | |
| `seed_category` | enum | `hybrid_branded`, `other_hybrid`, `local`, `mixed`. |
| `seed_type` | string | Exact variety; falls back with a warning if outside the vocabulary. |
| `hybridseed_kg_ph`, `localseed_kg_ph` | number | kg/ha. |
| `dap_kg_ph`, `urea_kg_ph`, `can_kg_ph`, `npk_kg_ph`, `lime_kg_ph` | number | kg/ha. |
| `compost_wheelbarrows_per_acre` | number | As surveyed. |
| `plant_date` / `plant_date_doy` | date / number | Only the day of year is used. |
| `intercrop`, `intercrop_type` | boolean, string | Legumes are treated distinctly. |
| `hh_num`, `hh_num_under18`, `cows`, `owns_oxen`, `owns_electricity` | | Household context. |

Request-level options: `year` (a default season for plots without one),
`include_plot_predictions` (default `true`), `min_plots` (override the
reporting threshold).

### What happens to the request

The model consumes **143 columns** — the 66 engineered features plus the 89
weather columns feeding its PCA basis. Each plot is expanded to all of them:

1. **Anything derivable from your input is derived**, using the formulas in
   `scripts/build_features.py`. A `dap_kg_ph` of 60 sets the winsorized
   companion, `n_kg_ph`, `p2o5_kg_ph`, `total_nutrient_kg_ph`, the outlier flag
   and the missingness flag — the same columns it moved during training.
2. **Everything else is filled from that district's history**: observed weather
   for the district-season when available, otherwise its climatology, then the
   district's own medians, then national medians.

Values above the winsorization ceilings applied during cleaning (500 kg/ha for
fertiliser, for instance) are clipped and warned about, never rejected — the raw
survey columns legitimately carry entry errors up to 45,922 kg/ha.

`inputs_supplied` on each result lists exactly which model columns your request
determined, so a caller can see how much of the prediction is theirs.

### Response

```json
{
  "model_version": "district_v2",
  "unit": "kg/ha",
  "n_plots_scored": 1,
  "districts": [
    {
      "district": "bungoma", "year": 2020, "n_plots": 1,
      "predicted_mean_yield_kg_ph": 2802.7,
      "interval_low_kg_ph": 1604.8, "interval_high_kg_ph": 4000.6,
      "interval_sd_kg_ph": 934.6, "interval_coverage": 0.8,
      "below_reporting_threshold": true, "district_known": true
    }
  ],
  "plots": [
    {
      "plot_id": "farm-104", "index": 0, "district": "bungoma",
      "district_known": true, "year": 2020,
      "predicted_yield_kg_ph": 2802.7,
      "inputs_supplied": ["plot_acres", "plot_hectares", "dap_kg_ph", "..."],
      "inputs_supplied_count": 25,
      "used_season_weather": true,
      "warnings": []
    }
  ],
  "warnings": ["1 district mean(s) rest on fewer plots than the model's reporting threshold …"],
  "accuracy_note": "District means are the unit this model was validated on …"
}
```

Read the flags. `below_reporting_threshold` means fewer plots back that mean
than the model's threshold (20), which makes it largely sampling noise.
`district_known: false` means the model never saw that district in training —
measured level error for such districts is roughly twice as large.
`used_season_weather: false` means climatological averages stood in for observed
weather.

### How good are these numbers

District means are the validated unit: **out-of-time R² 0.22–0.59, MAE 300–700
kg/ha**, depending far more on the season than on the model. Per-plot estimates
are returned because a per-farm UI needs something to show, but they are much
weaker (**R² ≈ 0.16**) and deliberately shrunk toward the mean — most
plot-to-plot variance comes from soil and management detail the survey never
captured. Present them as indicative, not as a farm forecast.

**The lean request path costs almost nothing.** Scoring all 6,190 real 2020
plots through the API and comparing against the pipeline given the true
engineered rows: plot-level correlation 0.988 (mean absolute difference 68
kg/ha), district-level correlation 0.998 (34 kg/ha), and identical accuracy
against observed district means. Filling from district history rather than
demanding 143 columns does not meaningfully degrade the prediction.

### Errors

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `422` | Malformed request: no plots, missing `district`, negative rate, unknown field, over the size cap. |
| `503` | Model artefact or feature defaults unavailable. The message says how to fix it. |
| `500` | Prediction failed unexpectedly; the exception type is in the message. |

## 3 · `POST /api/v1/recommend`

Ranks the changes available to one plot, each with an expected yield lift, an
interval and the evidence behind it. This is the field-agent surface of
CRISP-DM report §6.1.

**Everything is in kg/ha.** There is no costing and no budget. Report §1.4
records that this workbook carries no fertiliser or farm-gate price data and
that Project 1's recommendation layer must stay in yield units rather than
depending on price assumptions nobody supplied. Turning a lift into money is
Project 3's scope.

**It does not need the model artefact.** Lifts come from the fitted lever
curves in `data/api/lever_curves.json`, which are committed. A deployment whose
`pipeline.joblib` never arrived still gives advice; only the optional
`baseline_predicted_yield_kg_ph` is omitted, with a warning.

### Request

```json
{
  "plot": { "district": "bungoma", "plant_date_doy": 110,
            "seed_category": "local", "dap_kg_ph": 0, "can_kg_ph": 0,
            "plot_acres": 1.0 },
  "year": 2020
}
```

`plot` is exactly the `PlotInput` of `/predict`, so a frontend uses one form for
both. Everything else is optional:

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `levers` | Restrict to named levers. `GET /api/v1/reference/levers` lists them. |
| `min_lift_kg_ph` | Ignore changes worth less than this (default 25). |
| `min_support` | Refuse any target with fewer comparable plots behind it (default 200). |
| `include_curve` | Return each lever's whole fitted response curve, for plotting. |

The request model forbids unknown fields, so a stray `budget`, `prices` or
`objective` is a `422` rather than a silently ignored key.

### Response

```json
{
  "district": "bungoma", "district_known": true, "year": 2020,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "rank": 1, "lever": "hybrid_seed", "label": "Share of seed that is hybrid",
      "action": "plant a larger share of hybrid seed — 0.95 share of seed (0-1) (now 0)",
      "current_value": 0.0, "recommended_value": 0.95,
      "current_is_assumed": false,
      "expected_lift_kg_ph": 586.4,
      "lift_low_kg_ph": 545.8, "lift_high_kg_ph": 627.0,
      "lift_share_of_district_yield": 0.197,
      "evidence": {

        "confidence": "high", "t_statistic": 23.75,
        "uncontrolled_lift_kg_ph": 829.6, "control_absorbed_share": 0.293,
        "trained_to_2019_lift_kg_ph": 591.2,
        "curve_shape": "concave_increasing", "agronomically_plausible": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "bundle": { "levers": ["hybrid_seed", "..."], "total_expected_lift_kg_ph": 2447.4,
              "lift_low_kg_ph": 1806.3, "lift_high_kg_ph": 3088.5,
              "lift_share_of_district_yield": 0.821,
              "district_mean_yield_kg_ph": 2982.6, "note": "..." },
  "skipped": [{ "lever": "intercropping", "reason": "no change to this lever clears the evidence threshold..." }],
  "warnings": ["..."], "method_note": "...", "causal_note": "..."
}
```

Four fields deserve attention because they are what separate this from a
confident-looking number:

- **`current_is_assumed`** — `true` when the request did not say what the plot
  currently does, so the district's median practice stood in. The lift then
  describes a typical plot in that district, not this one.
- **`support_at_target`** — plots observed near the recommended value. Thin
  support is the main way a fitted optimum misleads: only 4% of plots apply any
  lime, so its fitted optimum sits in a region holding ~100 of them.
- **`uncontrolled_lift_kg_ph`** — the same contrast fitted with no covariates.
  The gap to the headline is how much of the raw association is *who chooses the
  input* rather than the input. It runs 29–50% across levers.
- **`trained_to_2019_lift_kg_ph`** — the same contrast refit on 2016–2019 only.

`skipped` is not an error list. "No change to this lever clears the evidence
threshold" for a plot already at its district's fitted optimum is the correct
answer, and an empty `recommendations` array is a legitimate response.

### Why the lift is not read off the yield model

Report §4.1 proposes a constrained search over the trained GBM's predicted
surface. That is the wrong instrument here and the notebooks say why: per-plot
out-of-time R² is ~0.16 and `district` alone accounts for ~60% of the model's
holdout performance, so optimising over that surface returns advice with a
precision the evidence cannot carry.

The estimand advice needs is different from the one the model targets — not
*what will this plot yield* but *how does yield move when this decision moves* —
and that average gradient is estimable from ~21,000 plots even where per-plot
prediction is weak. Notebook 03 §6 demonstrated it on planting date; the
recommendation layer generalises the same fixed-effects method to every ex-ante
lever. Full method, fitted curves and limitations:
[kenya_maize_recommendation_layer.md](kenya_maize_recommendation_layer.md).

### Errors

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `422` | Malformed plot, or an unknown lever name (the message lists the valid ones). An unknown *district* is not an error — it is advised, with a warning. |
| `503` | `feature_defaults.json` or `lever_curves.json` is missing. Build them with the two scripts in §1. |

## 4 · `GET /api/v1/model/summary`

What the deployed model is and how well it does. Everything quantitative comes
from the artefact's `metadata.json`, so a retrained model reports its own
figures rather than numbers frozen in code.

Works whether or not the weights are loaded — the metadata is committed beside
the artefact — so a deployment still waiting on its model file can report what
it is meant to be serving. `status` is `ready` (weights loaded), `not_loaded`
(metadata only) or `unavailable` (neither).

Returns: `train_seasons`, `validation_seasons`, `n_training_plots`,
`ensemble_members`, `min_plots_for_reporting`, per-season `validation` metrics
(R², weighted R², MAE, RMSE, correlation, bias), a `headline` block, the
`interval` parameters, an `expected_performance` block including accuracy by
district size and why the R² ≥ 0.70 target is unreachable with this data,
`limitations` (the six stated limits from the deployment guide), and `artefact`
/ `feature_defaults` diagnostics.

## 5 · Reference and health

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/reference/districts` | The 51 districts the model knows, and the seasons available. |
| `GET /api/v1/reference/district-map` | Each district's location (median plot GPS, since no boundary file exists) and historical mean yield, plus the Kenya bounding box every GPS pair was validated against and the yield range for a colour scale. Built by `scripts/build_district_geo.py` into `data/api/district_geo.json`. Used by the frontend map view; there is no polygon here, so a filled-region look is the frontend's own tessellation of these points. |
| `GET /api/v1/reference/seed-types` | Seed categories, varieties, primary varieties, intercrop species. |
| `GET /api/v1/reference/input-schema` | Every accepted field with type, unit, allowed values and observed range — enough to build and validate a form. |
| `GET /api/v1/reference/levers` | The eight controllable levers `/recommend` can advise on, each with its fitted curve shape and whether it matches its agronomic prior. |
| `GET /health` | Liveness. Answers `ok`/`degraded` even with no model. Use for platform health checks. |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness: `200` only when defaults are present and the model loads. Use to gate traffic. |
| `GET /` | Service index. |

## 6 · Regenerating the artefacts

`data/api/feature_defaults.json` holds per-district and per-district-season
medians and modes for all 143 model columns, the category vocabularies, the
observed ranges and the winsorization ceilings.

```bash
python scripts/build_api_defaults.py
```

Rebuild it whenever the feature file or the recommended-feature list changes.
It needs only pandas and numpy — not the model stack — and stores no
target-derived quantity, so it carries no leakage.

`data/api/lever_curves.json` (~38 KB) holds the fitted response curve for each
lever: its spline basis, coefficients, district-clustered covariance, the
support behind each proposable value, and the uncontrolled and 2016–2019 refits
used as diagnostics.

```bash
python scripts/build_lever_curves.py
```

Also pandas and numpy only. Unlike the fill values this artefact **is**
target-derived — it is a set of regression coefficients — so it must be refit,
not carried forward, whenever the feature file changes.

`data/api/district_geo.json` (~15 KB) holds each district's median plot GPS
and historical mean yield, read by `GET /api/v1/reference/district-map`.

```bash
python scripts/build_district_geo.py
```

Pandas and numpy only, reading straight from
`data/cleaned/kenya_maize_cleaned.csv`. Rebuild it whenever the cleaned table
changes.

## 7 · Tests

```bash
pytest tests/                                         # model-dependent tests skip
MODEL_DIR=data/models/district_v2 pytest tests/       # full suite
```

`tests/test_api.py` covers prediction; `tests/test_recommend.py` covers the
recommendation layer and needs no artefact at all, since the curves are
committed.
